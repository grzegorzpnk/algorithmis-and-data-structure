In Go, a pointer receiver is a method receiver that uses a pointer to the receiver type. When defining methods for a type, you can choose between using a value receiver or a pointer receiver. The choice between the two depends on whether you want the method to operate on the actual value of the receiver or a copy of it.

Here's a brief explanation of value receivers and pointer receivers:

1. **Value Receiver:**

The method operates on a copy of the value of the receiver.
The receiver type is passed by value to the method.
Changes made to the receiver inside the method do not affect the original value.
Example:

```go
type MyType struct {
Value int
}

func (m MyType) Modify() {
m.Value = 42
}

func main() {
instance := MyType{Value: 10}
instance.Modify()
fmt.Println(instance.Value) // Output: 10 (unchanged)
}
```

2. **Pointer Receiver:**

The method operates directly on the original value of the receiver.
The receiver type is passed by reference (as a pointer) to the method.
Changes made to the receiver inside the method affect the original value.
Example:

```go
type MyType struct {
Value int
}

func (m *MyType) Modify() {
m.Value = 42
}

func main() {
instance := MyType{Value: 10}
instance.Modify()
fmt.Println(instance.Value) // Output: 42 (modified)
}
```
-------------

You cannot use a pointer receiver for simple types like int, float64, string, etc.,(neifther for built-in types such as []int) directly. Pointer receivers are typically used with custom types (structs or interfaces) to modify the state of the instance. Simple types are already passed by value, and modifying a copy inside a method won't affect the original value.
