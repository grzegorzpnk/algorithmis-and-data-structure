Arrays in Golang or Go programming language is much similar to other programming languages. In the program, sometimes we need to store a collection of data of the same type, like a list of student marks. Such type of collection is stored in a program using an Array. An array is a fixed-length sequence that is used to store homogeneous elements in the memory. Due to their fixed length array are not much popular like Slice in Go language. In an array, you are allowed to store zero or more than zero elements in it. The elements of the array are indexed by using the [] index operator with their zero-based position, which means the index of the first element is array[0] and the index of the last element is array[len(array)-1]. 

To remember:
*  **fixed-length**
* **homogeneous elements** 
* **not much popular like Slice in Go**
* Array is value type
